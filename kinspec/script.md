You are not your ideas.

### Intro

In fact, I'd argue it's hard to claim that they are even _your_ ideas.

In a way, maybe. However, are our ideas what define us? Or just a reflection? If
so, then a reflection of what?

I don't have _the answer_, but I am going to make the argument that:

- we are not our ideas;
- we do not own our ideas;
- we should not identify with our ideas,
- and we should treat our ideas, or collections of ideas, as autonomous agents in
  and of themselves.

### Body

How do you answer the question: "who are you?"

Should we define it based on what you do? What we have done? What you own, or
what you share? Maybe who you know? Your relation to your family? Maybe what you
believe? What you fight for? Something else? A combination of all the above?

Different cultures seem to emphasize different aspects of identity. Furthermore,
identity itself can often be fluid, depending most on the particular
context. So, I think it's safe to assume there is no _correct_ answer.

However, I think it's quite clear that we are not our ideas. In short, we are
merely vessels for ideas to live, grow, and replicate.

If anything, we should treat ideas that we have as our progeny; as children.

The analogy is not meant to to be direct, but if you think about it, then we are
responsible for our ideas, and our ideas help shape our actions and desires. In
the same way, we are responsible for our children, and our children help shape
our actions and desires.

Yet, we do not _own_ our children&mdash;they are not property. Children make
their own decisions and can be quite autonomous, even at early ages. I think
most people would agree that parents (or anyone) who attempting to completely
govern, control, use, and claim authority over their children (or any other
person) is unjust.

In the same way, I think ideas are not property. Sure, you may invest in ideas,
help them grow, improve them, but that doesn't make them _yours_. People invest
in their children, help them grow, improve them, but again, that doesn't make
them their _property_.

I think if you truly care about your ideas, then ultimately your should want
them to be independent of you. Reproduce if they want. Interact with other
ideas, without your choosing.

Eventually, I think one should hope they could become better than oneself; they
should surpass the mentor, growing to become something better.

"they" being student, child, or _idea_.

### Conclusion

This argument I have presented is not complete. Instead, the goal is to plant
the seed of an idea in your head. Maybe I'll expand upon the idea, but for now,
this is it.

I did not create this idea, instead, a variation of this idea was planted in my
head in a book I read. Now, I think it's trying to get out of mine, and into
yours. Will you nurture it?
