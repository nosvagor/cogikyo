What is the purpose of conversation?


## Intro

My favorite questions are those that seem obvious at first glance, but closer
inspection reveals that there is actually no clear answer. For example, this
scene from Arrival demonstrates how even a simple question, from our
perspective, can actually be quite complex:

Okay, so returning the initial question:

> What is _the purpose_ of conversation?

Unlike the aliens in Arrival, I can probably assume that you understand what
a question is, so we can skip over that part. However, is it actually safe to
assume that you know what I mean, when I'm asking about _the purpose_?

What do I mean, when I say _purpose_? Right away, the answer seems clear:
obviously "purpose" means the underlying reason, objective or goal.

Easy. Done. Video over, because all know the reason why we converse with one
another, right? It's simply to share what we are thinking? ...right!?

Well, not so fast. Basically, as you can see purpose is somewhat synonymous with
"why." That is, I could have easily asked, "Why do we engage in conversation?"

However, the same problem arises: "well, what do you mean by _why_?"

Finally, with the disclaimer of the way... Here is the core idea that I am
attempting to discuss:

I think there is a primary dimension upon which the purpose of conversation
exists, that is, the _purpose_ of conversation exists on a spectrum between
**Alignment** and **Discovery**.

Let's cull these damn definitional weeds.

First, here is a clip of Jordan Hall that brilliantly describes the problem I'm
attempting to solve here:

[The Equivocation Problem](https://youtu.be/qag_uAVWdk4?t=3998)

The discussion between Jordan and Jonh Vervaeke is extremely engaging;
I encourage you to listen to the full thing.

Hopefully, the motivation drill down on the definitions of some seemly obvious
terms is more clear now. Jordan describes a solution (geared towards
distributed governance), and I think the following claim is he makes is
reasonable:

I don't know what a proper protocol looks like for one way video like this, but
I'm attempting to deploy my own solution here, since I am communicating with
people I both hardly know, and whom hardly know me. I primarily want to avoid
endless debating terms later on, so we can focus on the core idea at hand.

Great, so let's begin by aligning ourselves around the first potentially
problematic term: _the purpose_.
