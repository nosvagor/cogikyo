What is the purpose of conversation?


## Intro

My favorite questions are those that seem obvious at first glance, but closer
inspection reveals that there is actually no clear answer. For example, this
scene from Arrival demonstrates how even a simple question, from our
perspective, can actually be quite complex:

[The Nature of a Question Scene](https://youtu.be/9YJRtvamIjU?t=53)

Okay, so returning the initial question:

> What is _the purpose_ of conversation?

Unlike the aliens in Arrival, I can probably assume that you understand what
a question is, so we can skip over that part. However, is it actually safe to
assume that you know what I mean, when I'm asking about _the purpose_?

What do I mean, when I say _purpose_? Right away, the answer seems clear:
obviously "purpose" means the underlying reason, objective or goal.

Easy. Done. Video over, because all know the reason why we converse with one
another, right? It's simply to share what we are thinking? ...right!?

Well, not so fast. Basically, as you can see purpose is somewhat synonymous with
"why." That is, I could have easily asked, "Why do we engage in conversation?"

However, the same problem arises: "well, what do you mean by _why_?"

Finally, with the disclaimer of the way... Here is the core idea that I am
attempting to discuss:

I think there is a primary dimension upon which the purpose of conversation
exists, that is, the _purpose_ of conversation exists on a spectrum between
**Alignment** and **Discovery**.

What do I mean? Well, if you're interested in hearing more, then keep
watching. However, we need to cull some damned definitional weeds before
continuing.

## Body

First, here is a clip of Jordan Hall that brilliantly describes the problem I'm
attempting to solve here:

[The Equivocation Problem](https://youtu.be/qag_uAVWdk4?t=3998)

The discussion between Jordan Hal and John Vervaeke is extremely engaging;
I encourage you to listen to the full thing.

Hopefully, the motivation drill down on the definitions of some seemly obvious
terms is more clear now. Jordan describes a solution (geared towards distributed
governance), and I think the following claim is he makes is applicable here as
well. Let's listen:

[~80% Reduction Rationale](https://youtu.be/qag_uAVWdk4?t=4166)

Now, I don't know what a proper protocol looks like for one way video like this,
but I'm attempting to deploy my own solution here, since I am communicating with
people I both hardly know, and whom hardly know me. I primarily want to avoid
endless debating terms later on, so we can focus on the core idea at hand.

Sound good? Great, so let's begin by aligning ourselves around the first
potentially problematic term: _the purpose_.

### &rarr; the purpose

My current understanding of _purpose_ is best defined by the work of Daniel
C. Dennett. In particular, I'm importing his examination of the different senses
of "why" from his book, "From Bacteria to Bach and Back."

It should be noted I hold the assumption that, whenever possible, it's better
orient ourselves around terms or arguments that are well defined, articulated,
used, and expanded upon in work that is more widely known. At times, it may be
important to rebuild an argument from scratch, or find a more nuanced
definition, but I think it is safe to assume that we should stand on the
shoulders of giants and leverage the immense library of knowledge already out
there.

So, let's listen to Dennett's dissection of the different sense of _why_ before
preceding.

Excellent, so hopefully the distinction is more clear now. That is, when I ask,
"what is the purpose", then we'll both know that I'm asking for the emergent
_reason_ (**what for**), not _how come_.

I encourage you to read the whole book for a better understanding, but for,
acknowledging the ambiguous use of _why_, or _purpose_, is the relevant bit.

> [Tangent] >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Interestingly, this distinction may help explain _how come_ the childlike
tendency to ask "why?" over and over again is annoying. My speculation involves
two major components:

1.) "Why?" is a lazy question&mdash;it implicitly forces the respondent to
disambiguate between _how come_ and _what for_.

2.) Often times, we don't have good reasons. Generally, _how come_ is the better
question to answer, but both knowing _how come_, and how to explain _how come_,
takes a great theory of mind and understanding of the subject.

We might be lazily respond with "because I said so." However, I think there is
a better respond&mdash;simply ask the inquirer, "What do you mean, why?" Get
them to disambiguate the term, and ask a more directed question! This will
foster curiosity, instead of killing it.

Anyway, hopefully it's clear that I'm asking a reason, that is, "_what_ is the
reason _for_ conversation?"

I'm not asking for _how come_ we engage in conversation.

- Yes, maybe it's about simply a means information transfer and exchange.
- Yes, maybe it's due our evolutionary history, wherein selection forces help
  shaped our species into having a coordination superpower, and a desire to
  communicate, to converse, is essential aspect to this superpower.
- And/or maybe it's because of a massive list of interacting causes.

I'm not asking about those causes. I'm asking:

### &rarr; conversation

[Back to the good part](https://youtu.be/GI6CfKcMhjY?t=95)

Okay! Let's dive in. We're finally ready to tackle question and elaborate on my
conjecture... Well, we are almost ready.

The next essential import comes from Peter Boghossian and James A. Lindsay, from
their book, "How to Have Impossible Conversations."

Particularly, the excerpt comes early on, from chapter two, titled "The Seven
Fundamentals of Good Conversations."

> Two: The Seven Fundamentals Of Good Conversation | Audio clip 2:25 -- 3:43

Unsurprisingly, given our context, the most fundamental, fundamental
is... Goals, that is, "What's Your Purpose?"

This may seem so obvious it doesn't need to be stated, but for me, it felt like
my entire world changed when I was first exposed to this idea.

Of course, I'm sure we all may be somewhat aware of our goals when we talk to
someone. However, taking a moment to explicitly acknowledge what my goals were,
that is, _what_ the conversation was _for_, dramatically changed how
I approached, enjoyed, or choose to participate in, almost all conversations
I had going forward.

Let's listen to the list of reasons previously mentioned again:

> Two: The Seven Fundamentals Of Good Conversation | Audio clip 2:44 -- 3:23

Of course, this list is non-exhaustive. Additionally, it's a list of discrete
and functional reasons. There are probably many other reasons, and plenty of
times where it feels like there is no reason.

Crucially, it's this observation, that is, "at times it feels like there is no
reason" that I have wrestled with for such a long time. Is this observation
true? Or am I failing to understand a potentially hidden reason?

What is the reason that "just talk and connect" really describing? Is that not
still a discrete, functional reason? Does "just hanging out" count as nothing,
or is there still a emergent purpose involved?

Why (or rather, _how come_) are so many of the most enjoyable conversations
merely a collective rehashing of shared memories, where often everyone involved
is aware of the event, yet nearly everyone undoubtedly enjoys going over it
together. Are those all just conversations with, _no reason_?

[Tales of bread and wine](https://youtu.be/Zq0aboAocks?t=26)

My hypothesis: no conversation exists without a purpose.

Wait, really? Am I serious? Surely, there are some without purpose. Maybe I'm
just overanalysing it? Maybe taking this fundamental too literally can actually
hurt a conversation?

Potentially true; this uncertainty is in large part why I'm making this video,
to explore such uncertainties.

However, at this time, I do think every single conversation is serving some end,
some purpose. Most often, we are not aware of it, and I think many of the
difficulties that people have when talking to others often is due to a singular
problem&mdash;the inability to determining the purpose of the conversation.

Every good hypothesis is falsifiable, so let's improve my hypothesis by
introducing a mechanism whereby it could be shown to be false.

A more formalized hypothesis:

> Every conversation has at least one purpose; each purpose exists on
> a continuous dimension, with **alignment** on one end, and **discovery** on
> the other.

I'm less certain about the following propositions, but they might be helpful to
take into account:

> 1.) The purpose of a conversation does not vary, instead, conversations can
> contain other conversations.
>
> 2.) There is no ultimate hierarchy to the set of all conversations, instead,
> it depends on the reference frame of the parties involved.

If I am wrong, then there exists some conversation wherein there is no
motivation to either align the parties involved, or discover information about
the parties involved.

### alignment &harr; discovery

So, how am I defining alignment and discovery?

Well, let's begin by reexamining the list of goals previously mentioned and
mapping them to this dimension. Let's give alignment a value of max value of
-10, and discovery a max value of 10.

Note: the decision on the scale, or the direction is arbitrary. Left and right,
positive and negative, up and down... They all mean nothing, except in relation
to each other. Also, conversations can more than 2 participants, but for now,
let's just assume there are only two parties involved, for brevity's sake.

- **Reaching a mutual understanding** &rarr; &asymp; **4**: this involves
  discovering and understanding the other parties, but also about aligning all
  parties around a shared understanding.
- **Learning from each other** &rarr; &asymp; **6**: this is more about
  discovery, but still involves understanding some aspect the other party and
  aligning around that fact, since it is mutual.
- **Finding the truth** &rarr; &asymp; **10**: this generally involves being as
  objective as possible, so alignment is not necessarily at all (potentially
  even discouraged); excluding standardizations that allow for communication to
  take place at all.
- **Intervening** &rarr; &asymp; **-7**: this is pretty close to a focus of pure
  alignment, as generally it involves redirection towards the party's
  position. However, it can be used a means for discovery, if the one explicitly
  desires the other party to change their beliefs in order to understand
  something.
- **Impressing** &rarr; &asymp; **-10**: this result assumes that the impressing
  is only done by one party, and the other party would be using the conversation
  to learn. Or, there could be a tit-for-tat scenario that trades impressing
  back and forth in order to share selectively valuable information; this
  example shows how easily conversations can exist within other
  conversations. Regardless, impressing is often entirely done to reveal
  information to the other party in order to align the other with themselves in
  some way (e.g., get them to like you).
- **Yielding to coercion** &rarr; &asymp; **0**: very neutral; either it's not
  even a genuine conversation, or it is case dependent. Any direction toward
  alignment or discovery would presumably be done merely as a means get out of
  the conversation. For example,
  - it could actually be a means of impressing, as one party is only
    participating in order to not offend someone, or not appear awkward, or not
    cause a scene.
  - or an authority (or a party with more situational power) is threatening the
    other to comply, and the participating party is primarily just trying to
    discover how stop the threat.


Of course, there is no objective scale I used to generate these
numbers. Therefore, it's probably hard to replicate and falsify my hypothesis if
I don't at least attempt to make way quantify "reasons for a conversation".

Thus, I admit, it might be possible that I could mentally-stretch and
forcibly-fit any example onto this spectrum. In such case, then my hypothesis
would probably explain nothing, since it explains everything.

I think a way around this problem (if I really wanted to test it, in
a theoretical sense), then I would take two large groups of people selected at
random from diverse populations and cultures (best attempt at a general
representative sample possible).

Both groups would be told that they are going to group conversations by
a general purpose, or _reason for_ the conversation.

One group would be shown several examples of how conversation were mapped
somewhere in-between alignment and discovery as their primary _purpose_.

The other group (the control group) would be told nothing, and just ask to group
reasons (if any) in any way they see fit.

Under this setup, then I'd predict that:

- one could more reliably reproduce results from the experimental group, as the
  framing is more narrow and easier to follow.
- the control group results would be harder to reproduce, but in general, there
  would probably be patterns in how the conversations are grouped across
  iterations.
- If certain types of conversations are hard to categorize, or map to the
  spectrum, then potentially these would be examples wherein the primary purpose
  does not fit, or doesn't exist at all. Maybe the given conversation itself _is
  the purpose_; there is not primary end?
- Both the control group and the experimental group would predictable struggle
  with similar odd situations, indicating that the framing of what _the purpose_
  is was poorly communicated or heavy-handed.

## Conclusion
