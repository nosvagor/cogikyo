What is the purpose of conversation?

## Intro

The best questions often appear simple, yet upon closer examination,
tend to expose an underlying intricacy rich with potential wisdom. For example,
this scene from Arrival demonstrates how even a straightforward question, from
a different perspective, can be quite nuanced:

[The Nature of a Question Scene](https://youtu.be/9YJRtvamIjU?t=53)

Okay, so returning to the initial question: what is _the purpose_ of conversation?

Unlike the aliens in Arrival, I can probably assume that you understand what
a question is, so we can skip over that part. However, is it actually safe to
assume that you know what I mean when I'm asking about _the purpose_?

At first, the answer seems clear: it means the underlying reason, objective or
goal.

Easy. Done. Video over... because we all know the reason why we converse with
one another, right? It's simply to share what we are thinking? ...right?

Well, not so fast, let's take a step back. First, _purpose_ appears to be
somewhat synonymous with "why." That is, I could have easily asked, "Why do we
engage in conversation?"

However, the same problem arises: "well, what do you mean by _why_?"

Now, with the disclaimer of the way... Here is the core idea I'll be
exploring:

I think there is a primary dimension upon which the purpose of conversation
exists, that is, it exists somewhere on a spectrum between **Alignment**
and **Discovery**.

What do I mean by Alignment and Discovery? Well, I promise I'll reveal that
later, but first, we need to orient ourselves around some terms before
continuing.

## Body

First, here is a clip of Jordan Hall that brilliantly describes the problem I'm
attempting to address here:

[The Equivocation Problem](https://youtu.be/qag_uAVWdk4?t=3998)

The discussion between Jordan Hal and John Vervaeke is extremely engaging;
I encourage you to listen to the entire conversation&mdash;links to all referenced
content will be in the description.

Hopefully, the motivation to drill down on the definitions of some seemly obvious terms
should more clear now. Jordan proposes a solution (geared towards distributed
governance), and I think the following claim of his is applicable here as
well. Let's listen:

[~80% Reduction Rationale](https://youtu.be/qag_uAVWdk4?t=4166)

Now, I'm not sure what the proper protocol is for a one-way video like this
entails, but I'm attempting to deploy a solution, as I'm communicating
with people who barely know me and vice versa. My primary goal is to avoid
endlessly debating terms later on, allowing us to focus on the core idea at
hand.

Sound good? Great. Now, let's begin by aligning ourselves around the first
potentially problematic term: _the purpose_.

### &rarr; the purpose

My current understanding of _purpose_ is best defined by the work of Daniel
C. Dennett. In particular, I'm importing his examination of the different senses
of "why" from his book, "From Bacteria to Bach and Back."

It should be noted I hold the assumption that, whenever possible, it's better
orient ourselves around terms or arguments that are well-defined, articulated,
used, and expanded upon, in work that is more widely known. At times, it may be
important to rebuild an argument from scratch, or find a more nuanced
definition, but I think it is safe to assume that we should stand on the
shoulders of giants and leverage the immense library of knowledge already out
there.

So, let's listen to Dennett's dissection of the different sense of _why_ before
preceding.

> Part 3. On the Origin of Reasons | Audio clip 11:56 -- 14:30

Excellent, the distinction is more clear now. That is, when I ask, "what is the
purpose", then we'll both understand that I'm seeking for the emergent _reason_
(_what for_), not _how come_.

I encourage you to read the whole book for a better understanding, but for our
purposes, acknowledging the ambiguous use of _why_, or _purpose_, is key
takeaway.

> [Tangent] >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Interestingly, this distinction may help explain _how come_ the childlike
tendency to repeatedly ask "why?" can be annoying. My speculation involves two
major components:

1.) "Why?" is a lazy question&mdash;it implicitly forces the respondent to
disambiguate between _how come_ and _what for_.

2.) Often, we don't have good reasons. Generally, _how come_ is the better
question to answer, but both knowing _how come_, and how to explain _how come_,
requires a strong theory of mind and understanding of the subject.

We might be lazily respond with "because I said so." However, I think there is
a better respond&mdash;simply ask the inquirer, "What do you mean, why?" Get
them to disambiguate the term, and ask a more directed question! This will
foster curiosity, instead of stifling it.

> <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

So, it should now be clear that I'm asking a reason, that is, "_what_ is the
reason _for_ conversation?"

I'm not asking _how come_ we engage in conversation.

- Yes, maybe it's about simply a means of information transfer and exchange.
- Yes, maybe it's due to our evolutionary history, wherein selection forces help
  shaped our species into having a coordination superpower, and a desire to
  converse is an essential aspect to this superpower.
- And/or maybe it's because of a massive list of interacting causes.

I'm not asking about those causes. Again, I'm asking:

> "_what_ is the general, emergent reason _for_ conversation?"

### &rarr; conversation

[Back to the good part](https://youtu.be/GI6CfKcMhjY?t=95)

Alright! Let's dive in. We're finally ready to tackle the question and elaborate
on my conjecture... Well, we are almost ready.

The next essential import comes from Peter Boghossian and James A. Lindsay, in
their book, "How to Have Impossible Conversations."

Particularly, the excerpt comes early on, from chapter two, titled "The Seven
Fundamentals of Good Conversations."

> Two: The Seven Fundamentals Of Good Conversation | Audio clip 2:25 -- 3:43

Unsurprisingly, given our context, the most fundamental, fundamental
is... Goals, that is, "What's Your Purpose?"

This may seem so obvious it doesn't need to be stated, but for me, it felt like
my entire world changed when I was first exposed to this idea.

Of course, I'm sure we all may be somewhat aware of our goals when we talk to
someone. However, taking a moment to explicitly acknowledge what my goals were,
that is, _what_ the conversation was _for_, dramatically changed how
I approached, enjoyed, or choose to participate in, almost all conversations
I had going forward.

Let's listen to the list of reasons previously mentioned again:

> Two: The Seven Fundamentals Of Good Conversation | Audio clip 2:44 -- 3:23

Note: this list is certainly non-exhaustive. Additionally, it's a list of
discrete and functional reasons. There are probably many other reasons, and
plenty of times when it feels like there is no reason.

Crucially, it's this observation, that is, "at times it feels like there is no
reason" that I have wrestled with for a long time. Is this observation true? Or
am I failing to understand a potentially hidden reason?

What is the reason "just talk and connect" really describing? Is that not still
a discrete, functional reason? Does "just hanging out" count as nothing, or is
there still an emergent purpose involved?

Why (or rather, _how come_) are so many of the most enjoyable conversations
merely a collective rehashing of shared memories, where often everyone involved
is aware of the event, yet nearly everyone undoubtedly enjoys going over it
again, together. Are those all conversations with, _no reason_?

[Tales of bread and wine](https://youtu.be/Zq0aboAocks?t=26)

My hypothesis: no conversation exists without a purpose.

Wait, really? Am I serious? Surely, there are some without purpose. Maybe I'm
just overanalyzing it? Maybe taking this concept too literally can actually hurt
a conversation?

Potentially true; this uncertainty is in large part why I'm making this video,
to explore such counterpoints.

However, at this time, I do think every single conversation is serving some end,
some purpose. Most often, we are not aware of it, and I think many of the
difficulties that people have when talking can be often traced to a singular
problem&mdash;the inability to determining the purpose of the conversation.

Every good hypothesis is falsifiable, so let's improve my hypothesis by
introducing a mechanism whereby it could be shown to be false.

A more formalized hypothesis:

> Every conversation has at least one purpose; each purpose exists on
> a continuous dimension, with **alignment** on one end, and **discovery** on
> the other.

I'm less certain about the following propositions, but they might be helpful to
take into account:

> 1.) The purpose of a conversation does not vary, instead, conversations can
> contain other conversations.
>
> 2.) There is no ultimate hierarchy to the set of all conversations, instead,
> it depends on the reference frame of the parties involved.

If I am wrong, then there exists some conversation wherein there is no
motivation to either align the parties, or discover information about the
parties involved.

### alignment &harr; discovery

So, how am I defining alignment and discovery?

Well, let's try to form a general sense of the definition by reexamining the list
of goals previously mentioned and mapping them to this dimension. Let's give
alignment a value of max value of -10, and discovery a max value of 10.

> Note: the decision on the scale, or the direction, is arbitrary. Left and right,
positive and negative, up and down... They all mean nothing, except in relation
to each other. Also, conversations can more than 2 participants, but for now,
let's just assume there are only two parties involved, for brevity's sake.

- **Reaching a mutual understanding** &rarr; &asymp; **4**: this involves
  discovering and understanding the other party, but also about aligning both
  parties around a shared understanding.
- **Learning from each other** &rarr; &asymp; **6**: this is more about
  discovery, but still involves understanding some aspect of the other party and
  aligning around that fact.
- **Finding the truth** &rarr; &asymp; **10**: this generally involves being as
  objective as possible, so alignment is not necessarily at all (potentially
  even discouraged); excluding standardizations that allow for communication to
  take place at all.
- **Intervening** &rarr; &asymp; **-7**: this is pretty close to a focus of pure
  alignment, as generally it involves redirection towards one of the party's
  desired position. However, it can be used a means for discovery, if the one
  explicitly desires the other party to change their beliefs in order to
  understand something new.
- **Impressing** &rarr; &asymp; **-10**: this result assumes that the impressing
  is only done by one party, and the other party would be using the conversation
  to learn. Or, there could be a tit-for-tat scenario that trades impressing
  back and forth in order to share selectively valuable information; this
  example shows how easily conversations can exist within other
  conversations. Regardless, impressing is often entirely done to selectively
  reveal information to the other party in order to align the other with
  themselves in some way (e.g., getting them to like you).
- **Yielding to coercion** &rarr; &asymp; **0**: very neutral; either it's not
  even a genuine conversation, or it is case dependent. Any direction toward
  alignment or discovery would presumably be done merely as a means get out of
  the conversation. For example,
  - it could actually be a means of impressing, as one party is only
    participating in order to not offend someone, or not appear awkward, or not
    cause a scene.
  - or an authority (or a party with more situational power) is threatening the
    other to comply, and the participating party is primarily just trying to
    discover how to stop the threat.

Of course, there is no objective scale I used to generate these
numbers. Therefore, it's probably hard to replicate and falsify my hypothesis if
I don't at least attempt to make way to quantify the "reason for
a conversation."

Thus, I admit, it might be possible that I could mentally-stretch and
forcibly-fit any example onto this spectrum. In such case, then my hypothesis
would probably explain nothing, since it explains everything.

I think a way around this problem (if I really wanted to test it, in
a theoretical sense), would involve taking two large groups of people selected
at random from diverse populations and cultures.

Both groups would be told that they are going to group conversations by
a general purpose, or _reason for_, the conversation. One group would be shown
several examples of how conversation were mapped somewhere in-between alignment
and discovery as their primary _purpose_. The other group (the control group)
would be told nothing, and just asked to group reasons (if any) in any way they
see fit.

Under this setup, then I'd predict that:

- one could more reliably reproduce results from the experimental group, as the
  framing is more narrow and easier to follow.
- the control group results would be harder to reproduce, but in general, there
  would probably be patterns in how the conversations are grouped across
  iterations.
- If certain types of conversations are hard to categorize, or map to the
  spectrum, then potentially these would be examples wherein the primary purpose
  does not fit, or doesn't exist at all. Maybe these would be examples where
  conversation itself _is the purpose_?
- Or, both the control and the experimental groups would predictably struggle
  with similar odd situations, potentially indicating that the framing of what
  _the purpose_ was poorly communicated or heavy-handed.

Am I actually going to do this experiment? I mean, it would be fun, but I don't
have the means to do it. However, I find it important to at least try to design
a realistic experiment that falsify one's own beliefs, otherwise such beliefs
tend to be a form of unproductive, dogmatic preaching.

Also, since I'm still in the exploratory phase of this conjecture, then I'm
going to avoid explicitly defining alignment and discovery. I don't want to lay
claim on these words. Instead, I'm merely trying to demonstrate there is
a dimension upon which _purpose_ can be mapped to that can help one self
reflect on their own goal.

Anyway, moving on: Let's explore a common question that is often raised at this
point, and one that I hinted at earlier. What about _deep_ conversations?
Meaningful conversations? ... And again, what about meaningless conversations?
How does the alignment & discovery dimension account for this variable?

### Shallow &harr; Deep

I admit, this feels like an orthogonal dimension, that is, a seemly unrelated
spectrum that conversations could exist within. It appears that, if you map
a conversation to some place between alignment & discovery, then one could
easily imagine that it could be possible to modulate how _meaningful_
a conversation is, without changing the _purpose_ of a conversation.

For a long time I supported this framing. Some conversations I had felt amazing,
energizing, and truly meaningful. While others, felt dull, a waste of time, and
often had a lingering, depressive impact on me.

I assume that everyone wants more of the former, and less of the
latter. I certainly do, and it's in large part why I became so interested in
_the purpose_ of conversations, because this self-reflection coincided with my
reading of _How to Have Impossible Conversations_. To me, it felt like the most
meaningful conversations were also the same ones that seemed to be on the verge
of being impossible.

Now, at this current time, I am starting to understand something I missed
before. I think the assumption I made was correct, most people hate shallow
conversations, but... I think I've dramatically failed to understand where that
meaning is derived from for the majority of people.

I've learned how to have these impossible conversations. In fact, I crave
them. I love talking to people that have crazy ideas or wildly different world
views than myself. The thing is, I worry most other people do not feel the same
way.

I'm not sure if it's the best analogy, but let me try one out to help explain
what I mean.

If you don't know how to ski, or you are still learning, then skiing is probably
going to suck. You're going to fall a lot, get wet, somehow get too hot and too
cold, your legs will hurt, and you'll probably get embarrassed if skiing with
people much better than you.

Once you learn, however, then skiing is one of those sports that easily gets you
into the flow state. That's because it's hard, failure matters (you can get
hurt), and you have instantaneous feedback if you're doing well, and doing well
feels amazing as you glide across the snow at high speed while adrenaline rushes
through your veins.

Now, maybe the analogy didn't do much for you, but I'm sure you've experienced
or heard of the flow state before, or heard of it; some even claim it has moved
a little too far into the poorly replicated pop psychology realm. However, the
point is, the _flow state_, or aspects of it, seem like an essential component
to making something meaningful.

Notably, the source of the flow state appears to be incredibly diverse, and most
dependent on the person experiencing it. The richness of the state appears to
correlate with how much experience with the activity, with more experience
leading to deeper and more meaningful experiences.

Bringing it back to my revelation: I've learned that I may derive immense meaning
from these impossible conversations, but most others do not. Unfortunately, I've
burned relationships I cared about due to my assumption that others enjoy such
conversations. I have often failed to walk away, or not dive deeper, when
I should have remained casual and saved the conversation for a different time.

Now, I struggle with determining _when_ I should have such conversations. I find
that the better I get at these impossible conversations, the less I enjoy
"normal" conversations. I feel more uncomfortable at parties, less likely to
express what I feel, and more isolated. Ironically, I feel more equipped to
have any conversation than ever before, so it's not a matter of being lost
here... I think it's more likely that I am somewhat addicted to these harder
conversations.

Perhaps I've never found the right crowd, and haven't tried hard enough to find
such people. It sucks, and I predict I'm not alone in feeling this way.

Hence, the topic of this video. Maybe, if I can return to the fundamentals and
determine the purpose of conversation as a whole, and understand how others view
the purpose of conversation, then perhaps I can be more adapt at having
conversations that I find meaningful, while not alienating and discomforting
others in the process.

> Anyway, personal psychoanalysis and anecdote over. Back to the point:

I don't think the richness, the meaningfulness, of a conversation is orthogonal
to the purpose. In fact, I think the previous assumption that it was orthogonal
is what has lead me to be confused about _when_ to have conversations.

I think the solution to my problem involves two previously mentioned
propositions. Again:

> 1.) The purpose of a conversation does not vary, instead, conversations can
> contain other conversations.

> 2.) There is no ultimate hierarchy to the set of all conversations, instead,
> it depends on the reference frame of the parties involved.

Essentially, most conversations have multiple, intertwining, branching, and
merging threads. Each thread could be said to be _a purpose_. Each party may
have a different initial, or primary, thread that they care about or assume the
conversation is on.

Some examples:

- A light conversation would have a rather neutral measure, wherein the parties
  involved don't care much about the contents. Either because there isn't time
  to get into anything deeper (the elevator), or perhaps one side is fishing way
  to dive deeper via use of simple questions that allow for alignment around
  shared virtues that may to serve as a sturdy foundation.

- Alternatively, a heavy conversation would have a very weighted purpose, like
  an interview (or interrogation), where one party is primarily discovering, and
  the other is primarily aligning the interviewer around their understanding of
  a subject.

- Others conversations, like flirting, would be meaningful, but still light and
  playful. This is because you have to maintain plausible deniability, playfully
  hiding and revealing your intentions in a fun dance; trying too hard to align
  or too hard to discover is would ruin the game.

- And what about the collective rehashing of stories among friends? Perhaps the
  hardest to give a reason for initially, but now should be obvious. The
  _purpose_ seems to clearly be to continually align a group around a shared
  narrative. Each story is an instance of the group recounting the story,
  highlighting the important virtues, and possibly sharing the culture to anyone
  new in the group.

Overall, I suspect the perceived depth of a conversation is more likely
a result of how close the current conversational thread matches the party's
personal goal. Presumably, if the goals of both parties align, then I'd bet that
there is a massive boost to how fruitful a conversation can be. Perhaps the
purpose of small talk still is to align parties, for the "real" conversation
that usually follows.

I think the largest component to my problem is not understanding how hard it is
to align with others, and I have failed to properly invest the time to align the
conversation before diving into discovery mode.

I personally love being shown how I was wrong. Yes, it always sucks in the
moment... but as long as I don't mess up too badly, then it is most often the
desired outcome. This is the second largest component to my problem, as
I overestimate how much other people tend to align with me on this point.

My current understanding suggests that that conversational depth is
potentially just a measure of how far away from the center, or how well the
purpose matches the party's goal&mdash;so optimizing for depth simply requires
more attention to conversations that focus on alignment.

## Conclusion

Another major influence for this hypothesis originates from a story from Richard
Feynman.

> [Feynman](audio clip)

Hopefully, I was able to articulate what I assume to be _the purpose_ of
conversations. Again, I hypothesize there always in is one, and it exists
somewhere between alignment and discovery.

Is this framing useful? I think so, since healthy conversation with each other
seem to be essential across all aspects in life. I bet that anyone who can
internalize this concept will be able to quickly orient themselves, increasing
the probability of having better and more enjoyable conversations.

I bet that if more people took the time to realize _what_ the purpose of
a conversation was _for_, then we'd start having conversations that mattered
more often; that bring us closer instead of dividing us; that serve to repair
historical misgivings, discover wondrous stories, new ideas, and alternative
points of view; that help grow and strengthen communities, governance, and
coordination.

Bold claims, I know. I suspect there are more questions bubbling to the surface
to back up these claims, and I hope to discuss them! I do intend to expand on
this idea by showing how better utilize the information gained when you reflect
upon where you might be at on the measure between alignment and discovery for
a particular conversation.

Next up will be a video exploring the idea of concave and convex
dispositions. The exploration of these dispositions should make the motivation
behind of mapping _the purpose of a conversation_ onto a single dimension more
clear and useful.
